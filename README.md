Nothing need to be installed or updated to run this project cause this project only aims at providing a proper organized file structure.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in how to create a common-used file structure to make machine learning projects more organized and more readable.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

For more details, please refer to the branch named `template`.

## To-dos<a name="To-dos"></a>

# :memo: Goals which i want to achieve:

* a structure containing full procedures of deploying model to a specific reality problem
* a structure containing efficient tools for the whole data processing for convenient code reconstruct

# :memo: Functions which is not for consideration for the moment

* `automatcally` connects data processing and modeling
* deploy online by python package like tensorflow, flask, Django .etc

# :memo: TODOs
* during kaggle completion, beautify the structure
