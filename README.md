For more details of this organized file structure, please refer to the branch named `template`.

## To-dos<a name="To-dos"></a>

:memo: Goals which i want to achieve:

* a structure containing full procedures of deploying model to a specific reality problem
* a structure containing efficient tools for the whole data processing for convenient code reconstruct

:memo: Functions which is not for consideration for the moment

* `automatcally` connects data processing and modeling
* deploy online by python package like tensorflow, flask, Django .etc

:memo: TODOs
