## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Before running this code, make sure by using Python versions 3.*, python packages including numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn are installed properly.

<!--Meanwhile, to use model [LightBGM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), use pip to install it as follows.-->
<!--```-->
<!--pip install lightgbm-->
<!--```-->

After above installation, the code should run with no issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

<!--For this project, I was interested in using the data oriented from a kaggle competition [Elo Merchant Category Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation) to better understand several questions and range top in this competition.-->

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

<!--The data processing is completed in "data_process.ipynb" notebook stored in "utils" folder and the modeling is completed in "train_valid_*.ipynb" notebook stored in the "model" folder.-->

<!--Raw data are stored in "data/data_raw" folder while some data files such as merchant data, transaction data are too large to upload. Training and testing data are stored respectively in "train" and "test" folder and a `.xlsx` file is provided for storing authority descriptions of all data files. All data are available for freely download in the competition page. Part of data after data processing would be stored in "data/data_processed" folder.-->

<!--All submit files are stored in "submit" folder, kernels used here are stored in "download" folder named by specific kernel name. Sub-folder named as "collector" is set for storing information such as data properties, model evaluation results and so on.-->

## Results<a name="results"></a>

<!--The simple findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://PaperStrange.github.io/).-->
