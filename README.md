# Introduction

This repository is a try to `design` a proper project structure used for kaggle competition or fun data mining

# :memo: Goals which i want to achieve:

* a structure containing full procedures of deploying model to a specific reality problem
* a structure containing efficient tools for the whole data processing for convenient code reconstruct

# :memo: Functions which is not for consideration for the moment

* `automatcally` connects data processing and modeling
* deploy online by python package like tensorflow, flask, Django .etc

# :memo: TODOs
* during kaggle completion, beautify the structure
